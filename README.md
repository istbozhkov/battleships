## Usage

You can start the game by running:
```sh
~ python main_menu.py
```

## Features

- Two difficulty levels: Easy (computer shoots at random) and Difficult (computer applies simple algorithm when shooting)
- Three board sizes: 6x6, 8x8, 10x10
- Three different ship configurations (size and length).

Note: Different options for the board size and ship configurations can be easily added from main_menu.py code, but it was decided that those options are enough to experience the game fully.
